def ngramify(corpus, n):
    """
    Convert a corpus of tokenized sentences into n-grams.

    This function takes a list of sentences (each sentence is a list of tokens)
    or a single sentence (list of tokens) and returns the corresponding n-grams
    for each sentence. Each n-gram is represented as a string of tokens joined
    by spaces.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    corpus : list of list of str or list of str
        The input text data. Can be either:
        - A list of sentences, where each sentence is a list of tokens (words).
        - A single sentence as a list of tokens.
    n : int
        The n-gram size to generate
        (e.g., 1 for unigrams, 2 for bigrams, etc.).

    Returns:
    --------
    list of list of str or list of str
        If input is a list of sentences, returns a list of lists,
        where each inner list contains the n-grams (as strings) for the
        corresponding sentence.
        If input is a single sentence, returns a list of n-grams for
        that sentence.

def ngram_bleu(references, sentence, n):
    """
    Compute the n-gram BLEU score for a candidate sentence against
    reference sentences.

    This function calculates a simplified BLEU score using modified
    n-gram precision and a brevity penalty. The n-gram precision is
    computed by counting n-gram overlaps between the candidate
    sentence and references, with clipping to avoid overcounting.
    The brevity penalty is adjusted to account for n-grams by
    comparing lengths appropriately.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    references : list of list of str
        A list of reference sentences, where each reference
        is a list of tokens (words).
    sentence : list of str
        The candidate sentence as a list of tokens (words).
    n : int
        The n-gram size to use
        (e.g., 1 for unigram BLEU, 2 for bigram BLEU, etc.).

    --------

    Calculate a unigram BLEU-like score for a candidate sentence

    This function computes a simplified BLEU score based on unigram overlap,
    including a brevity penalty.
    It counts the maximum number of times each word appears in any reference
    and clips the counts in the candidate sentence accordingly. Then it
    calculates precision and applies a brevity penalty based on the closest
    reference length.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    references : list of list of str
        A list of reference sentences,
